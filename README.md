# WatAI - CyberSecurity 23/24
The [WAT.ai](https://watai.ca/) CyberSecurity 23/24 team seeks to explore the features of 33 IoT attacks (of 7 groups) and develop lightweight
security Machine Learning models to detect and classify each attack.

# Dataset
The dataset is comprised of attacks grouped into seven categories: DDoS, DoS, Recon, Web-based, Brute Force, Spoofing, and Mirai.
46 features were extracted from each executed attack used to evaluate.

# Python Notebooks
I and several members of the team composed various notebooks:
- [Exploring Classical Models](https://github.com/KokYenZein/WatAI---CyberSecurity-23-24/blob/main/classic%20models/classical-ml-algorithms.ipynb):
exploring various classical machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Adaboost, Gradientboost, K-Nearest Neigbours, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost, and Random Forests.
- [Feature Exploration 2 and 8 labels](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yenzeinkok/yz-feature-exploration?scriptVersionId=150067677): exploring the correlation between various features for 2 classes and 8 classes
- [Feature Exploration 34 labels](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yenzeinkok/yz-feature-exploration?scriptVersionId=150433002): exploring the correlation between various features for 34 classes
- [Pipeline ](https://github.com/KokYenZein/WatAI---CyberSecurity-23-24/blob/main/classic%20models/pipeline-testing.ipynb): Evaluating whether a pipeline containing several models will improve prediction capabilities
